# FWUZIX Layout

A new keyboard layout generated by pairing the shortest-delay keys with the most common letter-pairs.

## Method

Please see the `method` directory for Jupyter Notebooks outlining the process. Simply, the 136M Keystrokes Dataset was used to extract average key-press delays and the most common letter-pairs were derived from the Blog Authorship Corpus. The shortest-delay keys were then replaced with the most common letter-pairs to form the FWUZIX layout.
